    title: Biography
    summary: |
    
      I am an undergraduate student in School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. I major in computer science and my
      second major is mathematics. My research interests include approximate algorithms in data streams and computer network systems.

      I am about to get my bachelor degree this summer. Then I will continue my research on my Ph.D. project in School of Computer Science, 
      advised by Professor <a href="https://yangtonghome.github.io/">Tong Yang</a>.
