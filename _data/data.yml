    title: Biography
    summary: |

      I am a CS Ph.D. student at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, advised by Prof. <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~linmacse/">Lin Ma</a>. I have immersed myself in research for two years and studied widely in database and networking system.  

      I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Peking University, where I worked on approximate algorithms in data streams and computer network systems with Prof. Tong Yang. I also finished my Bachelor's degree in Economics at Peking University.
