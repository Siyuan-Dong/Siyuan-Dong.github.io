          <h3 class="text-h5 pt-3">Why We Publish These Notes</h3>
          <p class="text--disabled pt-2">
            Since I entered senior high, I have kept the habit of taking notes for every courses I enrolled, even including mathematics
            which I used to do well in. The admission to PKU allows me to take electronic notes instead of paper-made documents for some 
            courses, which both saves my time and makes room for wider transmission. 
            <br>
            As is well known, students in PKU who major in computer science shall make breakthroughs in both academic and industrial circles. 
            Sadly, we notice that the so-called education has now been reduced to simply reciting and dictating review materials in 
            thousands of powerpoint pages for a higher GPA. This abnormal approach of assessing students calls on some students to share 
            well-prepared review materials for the sake of the entire group, and we are one of them. 
            <br>
            In short, we publish all review materials we have and used in preparation for many exams. Most of them have something to do with courses
            in School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. Other review materials are listed as well and they apply to courses in different 
            subjects. We hope that by refering to this website, most of you can save time for other valuable things, rather than spend the whole weekend
            sitting in front of the computer merely to prepare review materials for tens of or hundreds of classmates. It is really a boring thing.
