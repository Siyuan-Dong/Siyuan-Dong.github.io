          <h3 class="text-h5 pt-3">Why We Publish These Notes</h3>
          <p style = "text-align:justify" class="text--disabled pt-2">
            Since I entered senior high, I have kept the habit of taking notes for every course I enrolled, even including mathematics
            which I used to do well in. The admission to PKU allows me to take electronic notes instead of paper-made documents for some 
            courses, which not only saves my time but brings wider transmission into reality as well. 
            <br>
            As is well known, students who major in computer science in PKU shall make breakthroughs in both academic and industrial circles. 
            Sadly, we notice that the so-called education has now been reduced to simply reciting and dictating review materials in 
            thousands of powerpoint pages for a higher GPA. This abnormal approach of assessing students calls on some students to share 
            well-prepared review materials for the sake of the entire group, and we are among them. 
            <br>
            In short, we publish all review materials we have used in preparation for many exams. Most of them have something to do with courses
            in School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science. Other review materials are listed as well and they apply to courses in different 
            subjects. We hope that by refering to this website, most of you can save time for other meaningful things instead of spending the whole 
            weekend sitting in front of the computer merely to prepare review materials for tens of or hundreds of classmates. It is really boring. 
            <br>
            We welcome you to utilize or re-post our website for free once you are willing to indicate the source. However, we reserve the right to hold 
            accountable those who sell these documents for profit. 
            <br>
            We are looking forward to one day when every student in PKU no longer prioritize GPA at school and will not struggle to make ends meet. 
            <br>
            We are looking forward to one day when all instructors in PKU alter their way of teaching and simply reciting makes no contribution to 
            students' academic performance. 
            <br>
            We are looking forward to one day when the vast development of computer science makes this website an antique with no practical use. 
            <br>
            However, there is still a long way to go before that day comes, and we believe that this website still works in contemporary times.
